## This directory contains 4 scripts. ##

# i. Lofoten.m: A "tutorial" file for downloading and processing
# BGC-ARGO data. Requires OneArgo matlab package which is already
# part of the repository if you pulled these scripts through git

# ii. process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL.m: A function to associate BBP700/CHLA from BGC-ARGO
# with small and large particles. Requires a .mat file in the directory "matfiles"
# that contains  two data structures: one for BBP700 and one for Chl. 
# The function requires the name of a matfile and the name of the two datastructures in the matfile
# The function was tested using the "qc_filter" function from the OneArgo package (the code can
# be found in Lofoten.m). The structures needed to be separated because we only want
# to use qc 1,2, or 8 data for CHLA but raw data for BBP700 (BBP700 is generally not qc'd).
# The structures can actually have any data so long as they have 
# a. "CHLA_ADJUSTED" (just the Chl data structure).
# b. "BBP700" (just the BBP data structure).
# c. "PRES_ADJUSTED" (just the BBP data structure).

# iii. extract_aseanoise.m: A function to extract anually varying background noise from 
# BGC-ARGO BBP700/CHLA measurements obtained for a specific season (Dec-Feb,Mar-May,June-Aug,or Sep-Nov).
# Called by process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL.m.

# iv.  extract_annoise.m: A function to extract anually varying background noise from
# all BGC-ARGO BBP700/CHLA measurements (not just from data for a specific season as above). Called by process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL.m.

# v.   extract_monnoise.m: A function to extract monthly varying background noise from
# all BGC-ARGO BBP700/CHLA measurements. Called by process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL.m.

# vi.  Koest23_modelB_700.m: Script for converting BBP700/chla to POC by Daniel Koestner

# vii. Koest23_Lofoten_Map_POC.m/Koest23_Lofoten_Map_bs_bl.m: scripts to visualizing 
# small (bs) and large (bl) particle-associated BBP700 and Chla (Koest23_Lofoten_Map_bs_bl.m), as well as small and large
# POC (Koest23_Lofoten_Map_POC.m). For the latter, also calls Koest23_modelB_700.m to convert
# BBP700/Chla to POC. 

# viii.plot_bbp_chl_avg.m: A script to visualize float-average BBP700 and Chla estimates in
# small (bs) and large (bl) particles. Also for visualizing the mean, min, and maximum noise estiamtes
# for each of these variables.

# viv.RTQC_BGCARGO_BBP.m : A function for processing BBP700 following the protoca; of Dal'Ollmo et al., 2022, Open Research Europe
# Requries a .mat file in a specified path that contains at data structure for BBP700, which include BBP700 itself and the array
# BBP700_QC (QC flags obtained from float data). The script will replace the QC flags in BBP700_QC with those from the Dal'Ollmo 
# QC tests.

# viv.RTQC_BGCARGO_BBP_nc.m : Same as RTQC_BGCARGO_BBP.m, but takes as input a list of floast, the path to the
# netcdf files containing the float profile data, and the path to the netcdf files containing the float metadata.
# BBP700_QC (QC flags obtained from float data). The script will replace the QC flags in BBP700_QC 
# in the netcdf files with those from the Dal'Ollmo QC tests, and also output a structure with
# these QC values, the orignal BBP700 data, the associated PRES, time, lat, lon, and an array
# the specifies which tests failed for each profile.

# x: process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL_drv.m: a script that will take .matfiles containing data structures for
# BBP700 and chl-a, apply the viv.RTQC_BGCARGO_BBP function to BBP700, and then apply the process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL
# function to produce small and large BBP700 and chl-a. The chl-a data structure just requires pressure
# and chl-a, while the BBP700 data structure requires BBP700, BBP700_QC, and pressure fields.

# xi: process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL_drv_nc.m: same as process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL_drv.m, but instead
# uses a input netcdf files for BBP700 (currently does not use chl-a), and applys the function
# viv.RTQC_BGCARGO_BBP_nc. Returns the BBP700 structure just like process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL_drv.m,
# but also modfied BBP700_QC array of the netcdf files in the "profiles" directory
